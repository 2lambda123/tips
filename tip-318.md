## Simple Summary

Adapt to Ethereum London Release.

## Abstract

To adapt to Ethereum London Release we need add `BASEFEE` opcode in tvm and reject new contracts starting with the `0xEF` byte.

## Motivation

To provide millions of global developers with a custom-built blockchain system.
Tron is supposed to adapt to Ethereum London Release. So developers will develop smart contracts in Tron more conveniently.

## Specifications

#### `0x48`: `BASEFEE`

The `BASEFEE` takes no operand pop up from stack.

Get block's basefee. Return `0` in Tron.

#### Reject new contracts starting with the `0xEF` byte.

Disallow new code starting with the `0xEF` byte to be deployed. Code already existing in the account storage starting with `0xEF` byte is not affected semantically by this change.

After ALLOW_TVM_LONDON proposal approved new contract creation (via create transaction, `CREATE` or `CREATE2` instructions) results in an exceptional abort if the codeâ€™s first byte is `0xEF`.

## Rationale

Tier

`BASEFEE`: Tier.BaseTier
