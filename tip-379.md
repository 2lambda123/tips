## Simple Summary

Optimize VM execution.

## Abstract

Optimize VM execution by caching contract and runtime code for hot smart contract with LRU.

## Motivation

Once smart contract is deployed, its definition and code cannot be changed.

So we can cache some smart contracts that are frequently called for transaction execution. This will reduce the overhead of contract transaction execution.

## Specifications

Maintaining contract and code's LRUMap:

```
private static final LRUMap<Key, ContractCapsule> contractLruCache;
private static final LRUMap<Key, byte[]> codeLruCache;

```
By command `--lru-cache-size`, we can set cache size and default size is 100.

There are four scenarios that will cause the cache to be removedï¼š

```
1. The LRUMap is full and remove cache least recently used.
2. The contract selfdestruct.
3. Update contract's energy_limit.
4. Update contract's consume_user_resource_percent.
```

## Benchmark

TODO.
